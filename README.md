There are some simple demos when I am learning react.

### Usage

`npm install`

`npm run start`

The demos are in `src/component/`.If you want to preview other demo you could change the component in the `src/index.js` such as

```
ReactDOM.render(< LogControl / >, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Just change the LogControl component to other component which you want to preview.
